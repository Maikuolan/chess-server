PHP Chess Server is an asynchronous PHP server that provides functionality to play chess online over a WebSocket connection.

Similar to the [PHP Chess API](https://chesslablab.github.io/chess-api/), it can be hosted on a custom domain. However, while the API endpoints may take few seconds to execute — for example, a database query — the event-driven, non-blocking architecture of the chess server allows to handle multiple concurrent connections in an efficient way.

The chess commands are intended to run very quickly almost in real-time.

## Object-Oriented

The socket, the game modes and the chess commands are all implemented using OOP principles.

## Async PHP Frameworks

The flexible architecture of PHP Chess Server allows support for multiple async PHP frameworks, with the default one being Workerman.

- Workerman
- Ratchet
